The **Musical Artists** project is a web application that introduces users to popular Spanish musical artists. The project consists of two main pages:

### Main Page (index.html)

- Features a header with a menu icon to open a side menu.
- Displays a background image and information about the most popular artists.
- Provides a "Go up" link in the footer for easy navigation.
- Responsive design for various screen sizes.

### Recommendations Page (index2.html)

- Similar layout to the main page with a focus on user recommendations.
- Allows users to recommend artists by filling out a form.
- Displays a list of recommended artists with options to manipulate the list (move up, move down, delete, copy, and update).
- Utilizes local storage to persist user recommendations.

The project is styled using a custom CSS file, and it includes the Font Awesome and Bootstrap libraries for icons and styling.
